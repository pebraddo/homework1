    "text": "Powell Braddock\nAugust 27, 2025\nST 558 - Homework 1\n\nLet’s dive into what being a data scientist is all about: an interview with Powell\n\nQ: What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nA: Being a data scientist is about solving business problems using large amounts of data to create models that communicate major indicators as solutions.\nQ: What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nA: While statisticians infer significance in mainly batch or historical data, data scientists expand to real-time data. Data scientists also use more unstructured and unlabeled data, compared to statisticians.\nQ: How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nA: I view myself as more of a data scientist than a statistician. Specifically, I see myself most interested in the role of data engineer, where I have an average amount of business/domain knowledge and engineering skills. While I have very developed statistical skills, I don’t feel as strongly about utilizing them on a day-to-day basis as I do my engineering skills. In my current job, I’m working on optimizing ETLs, which is challenging and exciting.\n\n\n\nWe can begin doing some R code\nOur first chunk of code helps us determine the object y’s class, type, and structure.\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nOur second chunk of code uses the plot() function on the object y that was defined in the chunk prior. It has density on the y axis and the petal width on the x axis, with a specified value for both N and Bandwidth.\nIn order to ensure the code for this chunk does not print, we can specify echo as false."
